# Project Tardis - Client module

Welcome to Project Tardis, this is my humble attempt at taking you back in time (hence the name, get it?) to an era where Text Adventures where the greatest form of digital entretainment... with a twist. 

This project attempts to provide a client application able to serve as the game's UI using an old school text-based look & feel.

For details about this project, please refer to the following articles:
